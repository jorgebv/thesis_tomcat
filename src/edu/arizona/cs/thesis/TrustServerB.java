/**
 * This servlet is responsible for distributing identity tokens to clients that
 * it trusts. Each trust server should be aware of which patients' health
 * records is available to it, so that it is able to accurately answer trust
 * requests. A trust server may manage trust for multiple health record servers
 * (for example, one trust server for a city).
 * 
 * If a trust server receives a request for a patient that it cannot grant, it
 * should contact another trust server to obtain the token. The connections to
 * other trust servers use SSL, meaning that each trust server will only respond
 * to trust servers and clients that it trusts already. For now, each trust
 * server will follow a fixed route. In the future, a routing algorithm should
 * be implemented to allow for discovery of unknown health records.
 * 
 * The three servlets are not very different in terms of code and should really
 * only be one servlet. They are only 3 servlets for logistic reasons.
